# Application State with Redux

Managing global state at the application level can definitely be a challenge. While the Context API provides a mechanism to accomplish this very tactically, Redux is a library that specializes in sharing state between components using a global "Store"

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Redux (10,000' view)
- Global state management with a Redux Store (conceptually)
- The elements that make up a "store"
- The basic wiring (boilerplate) of Redux
- The roles of Actions and Reducers
- How the process of "Dispatching an Action" results in an update of the UI

#### Execute

- Implement the core Redux boilerplate code required to participate in a store-based state managed application
